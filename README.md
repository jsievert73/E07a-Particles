Playing with particles and emitters

This is an opportunity for you to play with some particles. As you hold down the mouse button, particles are generated and appended to self.particle_list. Through playing with the variables in this document you can alter what is being created. It is currently set up to look like an explosion of some form. You can even increase the density of your particles by adjusting the PARTICLES_PER_TICK variable which changes how many particles will be created per update while the mouse is held down.
